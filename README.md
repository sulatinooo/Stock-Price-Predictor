# Stock Price Predictor (LSTM Simulation)

A lightweight **browser-based simulation** of an LSTM-style stock price predictor built with vanilla **JavaScript, HTML, and Canvas**.  
This project demonstrates **time-series forecasting concepts** and front-end engineering skills — **not** a production trading tool.

##  Features
- **Responsive dashboard** built with HTML/CSS and custom Canvas rendering (no chart libraries)
- **Configurable model settings**: lookback period, prediction horizon, and complexity levels
- **Technical indicators**: SMA, RSI, MACD integrated into feature engineering
- **Simulation of LSTM training** with epoch status, RMSE, and directional accuracy metrics
- **Interactive visualization** of actual prices, training fit, validation, and future forecasts
- **Robust UX** with non-blocking training loop, status updates, error handling, and reset button
- **Lightweight, dependency-free** (runs fully in the browser, no backend required)
